Project Description
The Emergency Response Simulator is a console-based simulation game where players manage emergency units (Police, Firefighters, Ambulance) responding to incidents like crime, fire, and medical emergencies in a busy city. The game allows users to select the appropriate unit for each incident, score their actions based on response time and incident difficulty, and track their performance over 5 rounds.

Key Features
Emergency Units: Police (Crime), Firefighters (Fire), and Ambulance (Medical).

Incidents: Randomly generated incidents with types (Crime, Fire, Medical) and varying difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

User Interaction: Players manually select which unit to send to handle an incident.

Scoring: Points are awarded for correct unit selection, and penalties are given for incorrect choices. Points are based on response time and incident difficulty.

Technologies Used
C# (.NET Core or .NET Framework)

How to Play

In each round, an incident is generated with a random type and difficulty level.

The player enters the location of the incident and selects the appropriate unit to handle it.

Points are awarded or deducted based on the unitâ€™s ability to handle the incident and their response time.

The game ends after 5 rounds and displays the final score.
